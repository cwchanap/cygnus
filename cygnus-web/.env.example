# Crux API Server URL
# Set this to the URL where your Crux Python server is running
PUBLIC_CRUX_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Optional: TensorFlow.js model URL for in-browser transcription
# If not set, the app will try to load from /models/drums/model.json and will fallback
# to a signal-processing method if the model is not present.
# Example (place model.json and weight shards under public/models/drums/):
# PUBLIC_TFJS_MODEL_URL=/models/drums/model.json
